# Dijkstra Graphical User Interface (GUI) Project
A Graph Visualizer and Shortest Path Finder Using Dijkstra's Algorithm, Written in Processing.
	
## Usage
After running the program in Processing, you will be greeted with the map of Canada and nodes in the major cities.

Hovering over any of these nodes will change its color and show an image of the city.

Clicking on any two nodes will perfom Dijkstra's Algorithm to display the shortest path and flight time in a graph.
